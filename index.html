	<h1>Midterm Project - Physical Animation on Media Bias</h1>
	<h3>Our Project</h3>
	  <h5>Description:</h5>
	  <h6>We created a stop motion animation on the causes and effects of media bias. The storyboard can be viewed below. The story starts with a penguin upset that he has to pay for a newspaper. He then realizes that he can access the news on the internet. After browsing it for a while, he sticks with that one news source. We also show other penguins doing the same with other news sources. They eventually get into a fight about what they've seen on the news. This fight shows that consuming only one source of media can lead to bias and conflict between people.</h6>
