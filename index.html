	<h1>Midterm Project - Physical Animation on Media Bias</h1>
	<h3>Our Project</h3>
	  <p>Description:</p>
	  <p>We created a stop motion animation on the causes and effects of media bias. The storyboard can be viewed below. The story starts with a penguin upset that he has to pay for a newspaper. He then realizes that he can access the news on the internet. After browsing it for a while, he sticks with that one news source. We also show other penguins doing the same with other news sources. They eventually get into a fight about what they've seen on the news. This fight shows that consuming only one source of media can lead to bias and conflict between people.</p>

	  <h3>Creating the Animation</h3>
	  <p>Physical pieces:</p>
	  <p>We made all of our characters out of clay, and we made the backgrounds out of paper. We used clay because it is very easy to move around, which made it easier for the stop motion. We made the backgrounds out of paper because they were quick to draw/create.</p>
